# Urban-Decay-Cosmetics-Supply-Chain-Optimization-Dashboard-Using-Excel
This repository contains data analysis, visualizations, using excel and insights from a supply chain optimization project for Urban Decay’s beauty product line. It explores supplier performance, shipping cost vs. speed trade-offs, stockout risks, and revenue concentration across locations. 

# Overview

This project analyzes the supply chain operations of Urban Decay, a beauty brand facing stockouts, rising shipping costs, and supplier inefficiencies. Using a dataset of 488 SKUs, suppliers, and transportation routes, the analysis uncovers bottlenecks and provides actionable recommendations to optimize performance.

# Dataset

The dataset includes information on:

SKUs & Product Types – haircare, skincare, cosmetics

Supplier Details – names, lead times, production volumes, costs

Shipping Metrics – carriers, costs, delivery lead times, routes, and transportation modes (Air, Road, Rail)

Financial Data – revenue, profit, defect rates, inspection results

Stockout Risk – availability and demand alignment

# Analysis & Insights

Key insights uncovered:

Supplier Dependency Risk: Supplier 3 contributes ~30%+ of production volume → single point of failure.

Cost vs Speed Trade-Off: Route A (fastest, most expensive) vs. Route C (cheapest, slower).

Revenue Concentration: Texas and Alaska generate the highest revenue.

Quality Concerns: Defect rate anomalies signal urgent need for data validation.

Profitability: Average SKU profit ~$475, but uneven across product lines.

# Recommendations

Optimize Shipping: Route A for high-value markets (Texas, Alaska); Route C for cost-sensitive shipments.

Diversify Suppliers: Reduce reliance on Supplier 3; reassess Supplier 4’s role.

Improve Data Quality: Standardize defect reporting and enhance supplier audits.

Profit-Driven Strategy: Allocate premium shipping modes to high-margin SKUs.

Scenario Planning: Build what-if models for supplier failures and cost fluctuations.

# Outcome

Implementing these recommendations can help Urban Decay:

Lower costs while maintaining speed in top markets.

Reduce supply chain risk through supplier diversification.

Improve customer satisfaction by reducing stockouts and defects.

Scale operations sustainably as demand grows.
